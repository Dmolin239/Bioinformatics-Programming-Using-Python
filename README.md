# Bioinformatics-Programming-Using-Python
This repository is a collection of notes I made while reading "Bioinformatics Programming Using Python" by Mitchell L Model.
All concepts, coding examples, and problems are taken from this book. 
Origional code is my own.
All code was run on Python '3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 17:30:36) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]' via Conda
