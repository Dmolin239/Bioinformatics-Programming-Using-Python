#Booleans have two values: True or False. Their type is bool. Note that True and False are case sensitive so that True =/= true
#Examples include:
True
False

#Floats aka "Floating points" refer to scientific notation (i.e. digit and exponent). Python outputs very small/large numbers in scientific notation 
#Examples include:
2e4     #20000
2e-2    #0.02
.0001   #0.0001

#Strings are essentially characters such as letters or words with type str. A lone charager is a string length of one. If you want a string to span
#multiple lines, you mist enclose it in a matched pair of three single or double quotes. Additionally, '\n' represents new line and '\t' is a tab space.
#Examples include: 
'MNKMDLVADVAEKTDLSKAKATEVIDAVFA'
'myString'
